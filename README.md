# SkyblockMod
QOL changes that enhances your Hypixel Skyblock experience. Created to add features I couldn't find in a mod, or if the mod was paid (which is against the [Mojang TOS](https://account.mojang.com/documents/commercial_guidelines)). If I find a free mod has a feature, I will not add the feature in this mod.

## Current features
- Guild party desktop notifications (toggleable)
- Coordinate and angle display (toggleable)

## Commands
- /toggle [gparty/coords/list] - Toggles features. /toggle list returns values of every toggle.
- /setkey [key] - Sets API key.
- /getkey - Returns key set with /setkey
